# DREiVe

DREiVe is developed by Alona Sosinsky.

DREiVe stands for Discovery of Regulatory Elements in Vertebrates and it was originally developed by Alona Sosinky. However, the Perl scripts are very badly annotated (hardly any comments in the scripts) and the code has not been optimised for performance (hence in its current state, it is very slow). The best option is to use the web-based version but even this is problematic because of the way the output is produced (requires a lot of manual extraction).
Husam Hebaishi (based at KCL) is working on improving several aspects of DREiVe.

This directory is organized as follows:

The folder “DREiVe” contains the original source code for DREiVe in Perl

The manual is available (pdf file) for those interested in using DREiVe

The “Future changes” word document describes some of the anticipated improvements
