# DREiVe
DREiVe stands for Discovery of Regulatory Elements in Vertebrates and it was originally developed by Alona Sosinky. However, the Perl scripts are very badly annotated (hardly any comments in the scripts) and the code has not been optimised for performance (hence in its current state, it is very slow). The best option is to use the web-based version but even this is problematic because of the way the output is produced (requires a lot of manual extraction).
Husam Hebaishi (based at KCL) is working on improving several aspects of DREiVe.

This directory is organized as follows:
The folder “DREiVe” contains the original source code for DREiVe in Perl
There is a manual available (pdf file) for those interested in using DREiVe
There is a “Future changes” word document which describes some of the anticipated improvements
There is a directory called “Using Current web-based version of DREiVe”, which describes how to use the web-based version together with recommended parameters to use
Alona’s original unpublished manuscript is also available as a word document should anybody need to refer to it
